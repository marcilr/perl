Some code from GCI Network Services, OSS Mark Blum on establishing a network
connection with multiple connection attempts.  Looked like good code so
archiving here.

My guess is a network hiccup during connection (somehow some packets were
dropped during the connection setup; e.g. perhaps the CONNECTED message was
sent, but never made it to the script so MySQL thinks everything is all good
(and you simply aren't ready to send a query) while you script stays waiting
for the CONNECTED message).

One workaround is to build retry connection attempt logic into the script.

A relatively simply setup I like to use is:
my $i = 0;
my $dbh;
until ( $dbh )
{
    $dbh = eval { open_db_connection( $opt->{db}, $opt->{retry} ); };
    if ( $@ )
    {
        if( ++$i > $opt->{retry} )
        {
            log_die( "Unrecoverable error: retry count $i exceeds the retry \
            limit of $opt->{retry}." );
        }

        $logger->error( "Retry count: $i.  Error opening the database \
        connection: $@" );
        stall( $opt->{delay} );
    }
}

Of course there is a bit of code involved in the custom functions, but I think
overall the example is fairly self-explanatory.  It's easy to nick-pick on the
implementation but the basic concept is to try a couple of times before giving
up on the database connection (and give a little bit of time in between
attempts in the hope that any hiccups have cleared up).

Thanks,
      -Mark
