Operators


What does =~ do in Perl?
========================
=~ is the operator testing a regular expression match. The expression
/9eaf/ is a regular expression (the slashes // are delimiters, the 9eaf
is the actual regular expression). In words, the test is saying "If the
variable $tag matches the regular expression /9eaf/ ..." and this match
occurs if the string stored in $tag contains those characters 9eaf
consecutively, in order, at any point. So this will be true for the
strings

  9eaf

  xyz9eaf

  9eafxyz

  xyz9eafxyz

and many others, but not the strings

  9eaxxx
  9xexaxfx

and many others. Look up the 'perlre' man page for more information on
regular expressions, or google "perl regular expression"
