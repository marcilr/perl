Working on accessing UAA ITS MS SQL Server 2005 via perl from boothite
Debian Lenny workstation.


Packages
========
unixodbc-bin - Graphical tools for ODBC management and browsing
unixodbc-dev - ODBC libraries for UNIX (development files)
unixodbc - ODBC tools libraries

=============================
Would need to install unixodbc to get odbc up and operational.
ODBC sucks....


boothite:~# perl -MCPAN -e shell
cpan[1]> install DBI
CPAN: Storable loaded ok (v2.18)
CPAN: LWP::UserAgent loaded ok (v5.813)
CPAN: Time::HiRes loaded ok (v1.9711)

I would like to connect to one of the following sites to get
'authors/01mailrc.txt.gz':

 http://www.perl.org/CPAN/
 ftp://ftp.perl.org/pub/CPAN/

Is it OK to try to connect to the Internet? [yes] <== enter
DBI-1.609.tar.gz got installed

cpan[1]> install YAML
YAML-0.71.tar.gz got installed.

cpan[1]> install DBD::ODBC 
...
LANG environment variable is set to "en_US.UTF-8"
Looking for odbc_config on PATH
  odbc_config not found
Looking for iodbc-config on PATH
  iodbc_config not found
odbc_config not found - ok, there are other things I can do
Still trying to guess ODBCHOME - looking for headers now
  trying /usr/include
  trying usr/local/include
  trying /usr/pkg/include
  trying /usr/local/easysoft/unixODBC/include

The DBD::ODBC module needs to link with an ODBC 'Driver Manager'.
(The Driver Manager, in turn, needs one or more database specific ODBC
drivers. The DBD::ODBC module does _not_ include any ODBC drivers!)

You need to indicate where your ODBC Driver Manager is installed.
You can do this by:

o setting the ODBCHOME environment variable
o running 'perl Makefile.PL -o odbcdir'
o adding path to odbc_config/iodbc_config to PATH

If you do not have an ODBC Driver Manager you should try to get hold of
the unixODBC packages for your system or build it from source (see
http://www.unixodbc.org).
  MJEVANS/DBD-ODBC-1.23.tar.gz

Running make test
  Make had some problems, won't test
Running make install
  Make had some problems, won't install
Failed during this command:
