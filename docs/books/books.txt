  What's the story behind the camel?

  Re: Re^2: What's the story behind the camel? (no colophon either)
  by mpolo on May 12, 2003 at 10:05 UTC
  
  Camel III does indeed have it, but it doesn't say why the camel was chosen:
  "The animal on the cover of Programming Perl, Third Edition is a dromedary
  (one-hump camel).  Camels are large ruminant mammals, weighing between 1,000
  and 1,600 pounds and standing six to seven feet tall at the shoulders.  They
  are well known for their use as draft and saddle animals in the desert
  regions, especially of Africa and Asia.  Camels can go for days without
  water.  If food is scarce, they will eat anything, even their owner's tent.
  Camels live up to 50 years."

  The explanation in the text (p. 4) is the following (look up "camel" in the
  index... Now I have to find out about "bloody camels" and "pink vs. blue
  camels"!)

  "We often joke that a camel is a horse designed by a committee, but if you
  think about it, the camel is self-sufficient.  (On the other hand, the camel
  has not evolved to smell good.  Neither has Perl.)  This is one of the many
  strange reasons we picked the camel to be Perl's mascot, but it doesn't have
  much to do with linguistics."

Network Programming with Perl
  by Lincoln D. Stein
  Publication Date: January 6, 2001
  ISBN-10: 0201615711
  ISBN-13: 978-0201615715
  Edition: 1

  Any developer who's comfortable with Perl can build remarkably powerful TCP/IP
  network applications -- no C required!  In Network Programming with Perl,
  Lincoln Stein shows how, step-by-step, with extensive code examples.  Modeled
  on W. Richard Stevens' legendary Unix network programming book, this book
  opens up network programming to a new generation of programmer: Web developers
  ready to build serious network applications and solve complex network problems.
  Stein begins with an overview of Perl's increasingly powerful networking
  facilities; then introduces Berkeley Sockets, and the UDP and TCP protocols at
  the heart of network programming.  He presents Perl's IO:: socket API, which
  simplifies the creation and use of sockets; demonstrates how to create forking
  servers; and introduces practical techniques for creating multithreaded and
  multiplexed applications.  Modeled upon the style of Stevens, and using
  extensive sample code, Stein demonstrates all of the key features.  Network
  Programming with Perl also includes chapter-length explanations of creating
  Internet modules for FTP and Telnet; Mail and News; and Web services.

  "This is a superb book. Another splendid book from Lincoln, whose mastery and
  lucid exposition make this a must-have for the serious Perl programmer.""
