perldebtut - Perl debugging tutorial


A (very) lightweight introduction in the use of the perl debugger, and a 
pointer to existing, deeper sources of information on the subject of debugging
perl programs.

There's an extraordinary number of people out there who don't appear to know
anything about using the perl debugger, though they use the language every day.
This is for them.

List/search source lines:               Control script execution:

  - or .      List previous/current line  s [expr]    Single step [in expr]
  v [line]    View around line            n [expr]    Next, steps over subs
  f filename  View source in file         <CR/Enter>  Repeat last n or s
  /pattern/ ?patt?   Search forw/backw    r           Return from subroutine
  M           Show module versions        c [ln|sub]  Continue until position
Debugger controls:                        L           List break/watch/actions
  o [...]     Set debugger options        t [n] [expr] Toggle trace [max depth]    ][trace expr]
  <[<]|{[{]|>[>] [cmd] Do pre/post-prompt b [ln|event|sub] [cnd] Set breakpoint
  ! [N|pat]   Redo a previous command     B ln|*      Delete a/all breakpoints
  H [-num]    Display last num commands   a [ln] cmd  Do cmd before line
  = [a val]   Define/list an alias        A ln|*      Delete a/all actions
  h [db_cmd]  Get help on command         w expr      Add a watch expression
  h h         Complete help page          W expr|*    Delete a/all watch exprs
  |[|]db_cmd  Send output to pager        ![!] syscmd Run cmd in a subprocess
  q or ^D     Quit                        R           Attempt a restart
Data Examination:     expr     Execute perl code, also see: s,n,t expr
  x|m expr       Evals expr in list context, dumps the result or lists methods.
  p expr         Print expression (uses script's current package).
  S [[!]pat]     List subroutine names [not] matching pattern
  V [Pk [Vars]]  List Variables in Package.  Vars can be ~pattern or !pattern.
  X [Vars]       Same as "V current_package [Vars]".  i class inheritance tree.
  y [n [Vars]]   List lexicals in higher scope <n>.  Vars same as V.
  e     Display thread id     E Display all thread ids.
