Debug


A (very) lightweight introduction in the use of the perl debugger, and a 
pointer to existing, deeper sources of information on the subject of debugging
perl programs.

There's an extraordinary number of people out there who don't appear to know
anything about using the perl debugger, though they use the language every day.
This is for them.
