A Simple Perl Script to list all the installed Perl
modules on your server in your Web Browser

Formatted HTML output compatible with most browsers


Server and Module Requirements
==============================
o A *NIX server (Linux, UNIX etc) with Perl 5.006
  or later installed (It will probably run on Windoze
  too but it has NOT been tested on this platform.
  If you run it on a Win32 platform you do so at your
  own risk), 

o Requires File::Find Perl module to be installed on
  your server. (Most Servers have this module)
