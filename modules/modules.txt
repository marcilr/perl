Modules


Modules are an important and powerful part of the Perl programming language.
A module is a named container for a group of variables and subroutines which
can be loaded into your program.  By naming this collection of behaviors and
storing it outside of the main program, you are able to refer back to them from
multiple programs and solve problems in manageable chunks.

Modular programs are more easily tested and maintained because you avoid
repeating code, so you only have to change it in one place.  Perl modules may
also contain documentation, so they can be used by multiple programmers without
each programmer needing to read all of the code.  Modules are the foundation of
the CPAN, which contains thousands of ready-to-use modules, many of which you
will likely use on a regular basis.
