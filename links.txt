Perl 5 version 18.2 documentation
There are a few basic principles which define object oriented Perl:
1. An object is simply a data structure that knows to which class it
   belongs.
2. A class is simply a package.  A class provides methods that expect
   to operate on objects.
3. A method is simply a subroutine that expects a reference to an
   object (or a package name, for class methods) as the first argument.
