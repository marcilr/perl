PERL -- Practical Extraction and Report Language

Perl is sometimes called the "Practical Extraction and Report Language,"
although it has also been called a "Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister,"
among other expansions.  It's actually a backronym, not an acronym, since
Larry Wall, Perl's creator, came up with the name first and the expansion
later.  That's why "Perl" isn't in all caps.  There's no point in arguing
which expansion is correct: Larry endorses both.

You may also see "perl" with a lowercase p in some writing.  In general,
"Perl" with a capital P refers to the language and "perl" with a lowercase p
refers to the actual interpreter that compiles and runs your programs.  In
the house style, we write the names of programs like perl.

Why sometimes Makefile.PL fails?
================================
Sometimes, perl Makefile.PL fails with something like:

*** can not find package gobject-2.0 >= 2.0.0
*** check that it is properly installed and available in PKG_CONFIG_PATH
  at Makefile.PL line 81

When running perl Makefile.PL the most common cause of error messages 
similar to the above are missing devel packages. The problem is that you 
need to have the glib/gtk+/etc. devel packages installed, those include 
the necessary header files and the pkg-config files for compliation.

If you are on debian, you can install the pre-requisite packages using 
the following

$ apt-get install libglib2.0-dev
$ apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
